## Model Card – CH4Y Prediction from diet composition

### Model Details
• The global CH4Y prediction model developed by this work is designed to estimate methane (CH4) emissions during the fermentation process in ruminants based on various factors, such as diet ingredients and rumen modifier types.
• Developed by researchers at State Key Laboratory of Forage Breeding-by-Design and Utilization, Institute of Subtropical Agriculture in 2025.

### Intended Use
• Intended for promoting sustainable livestock diet formulation to reduce methane emissions.
• Intended to be used for further research in animal science, environmental sustainability, and climate change mitigation.
• Not intended to predict methane emissions for non-ruminant animals or scenarios outside the scope of current dietd ingredient datasets.

### Factors
• Relevant factors include diet ingredients, animal type, and rumen modifier types.

### Metrics
• The coefficient of determination (R²), root mean square prediction error (RMSPE), mean bias (MB), scale bias (SB), root mean square error (RMSE), and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) are reported to measure the difference between observed and predicted CH4Y.

### Training Data
• 80% of data used in training was collected from various reported observational data.

### Evaluation Data
• 20% of data used for model evaluation was held back during the training phase.

### Ethical Considerations
• The model provides valuable insights into the role of feed ingredients in mitigating CH4 emissions, promoting environmentally friendly farming practices without compromising livestock productivity.

### Caveats and Recommendations
• Due to the limited availability of data on newer feed additives and specific regional farming practices, future iterations of this model could include more diverse diet ingredient datasets and refined animal breed information for better generalizability.

### Quantitative Analyses
• As presented in the accompanying paper, the model shows a significant mitigation in CH4 emissions when optimizing diet composition, especially when integrating high-maize and 3-NOP diets.
